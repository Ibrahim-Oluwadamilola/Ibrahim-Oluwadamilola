        <h2>BEAN PUDDING</h2>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>3 Cups Brown/Black Eyed Beans</p><br>
        <p>Banana Leaves or Any Choice Containers for Steaming.</p><br>
        <p>2 cooking Spoon vegetable/ Sunflower oil</p><br>
        <p>1 Cup Chicken Stock ( Optional)</p><br>
        <p>2 Bell pepper (Tatashe) or Shombo</p><br>
        <p>1 Onion</p><br>
        <p>1 Atarodo</p><br>
        <p>3 Tablespoons Ground Crayfish<br></p><br>
        <p>1 Small Boiled or Smoked Mackerel (Titus)</p><br>
        <p>Smoked or Raw Prawns/Corned Beef (Optional)</p><br>
        <p>4 Boiled Eggs</p><br>
        <p>2 Bouillon Cubes</p><br>
        <p>Salt to taste</p><br>
        <h2>Preparation:</h2><br>
        <p>Firstly, soak your beans then peel off the skin. To make the peeling faster and easier, soak the beans for 10 minutes then, using the pulse function on your jug blender, pulse a few times. This will cause each bean to split and the skin to fall off. Then pour in a bowl and complete peeling by hand</p><br>
        <p>Now, you’ll need to blend the Beans. I prefer to blend with Stock to infuse the rich flavour from the start, If you don’t blend with or add Stock to Moimoi, then you really are missing!</p><br>
        <p>Add the Peppers and Onion and blend till smooth. The texture of your blend should be very fine and frothy, with absolutely no lumps</p><br>
        <p>Pour contents into a bowl. Now, you’ll need to incorporate air into your Moimoi batter to make it fluffy and light. It’s advisable to use a stand or hand mixer for this, but if you haven’t got a mixer, you can use a wooden spoon. Mix for 8 minutes thereabouts</p><br>
        <p>Melt the palm oil in your microwave or on a hob if you’re using any, leave to cool, then add to the batter, also add the Vegetable Oil. Mix thoroughly, then add the Bouillon Cube, Crayfish and Salt to taste. Also add Stock/Water, your Moimoi batter should not be thick or you’ll end up with hard Moimoi, the consistency should be semi fluid but definitely not watery. Mix your batter once again with your hand mixer for 5 minutes, this is so the condiments and oil are well incorporated.</p><br>
        <p>After mixing, Shred the Smoked/ Boiled Mackerel and add, also add any other protein you’re using, stir and combine</p><br>
        <p>Wash your leaves if using any, wash with a light foam sponge and salt to remove dirt and debris, then cut off the stalks.</p><br>
        <p>Fold your leaf in doubles, then scoop 2 cooking spoonfuls of batter into the folded leaves, add the Boiled Egg; either whole or half or as you desire, then fold over</p><br>
        <p>Repeat same process with the remaining batter till exhausted</p><br>
        <p>Arrange the wrapped Moimoi in a steamer. If you haven’t got one, line a big pot with the stalks from the leaves, add a few leaves also, this is to prevent the Moimoi from sticking to the pot and also keep water from seeping into your Moimoi. Lift the leaves and pour some water in the pot to steam the Moimoi with. Now, place the Moimoi on the leaves, cover tightly with a lid and steam for 40-50 minutes on medium heat or until it sets. Do remember to check every now and them and top up with water if necessary</p><br>
        <p>If you’re not using leaves, it’s basically the same process with using plastic bags, plastic containers or foil. Just scoop the batter in your choice container, place in your steamer and steam for 40-50 minutes. If you haven’t got a steamer, pour water into a pot and steam. Remember not to submerge the Moimoi in water</p><br>
        <p>And it’s done! Enjoy with Pap, Garri, Eko, Custard, Oatmeal or with Boiled, Jollof or Fried Rice</p><br>
